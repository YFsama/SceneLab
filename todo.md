# SceneLab — Roadmap & Technical Specification

> AI-first 3D CAD/CAM — Web-first + Tauri desktop shell

## Project Vision

An Autodesk Fusion 360–like parametric CAD tool where AI is a first-class citizen. Users drive modeling, constraints, and toolpath generation with natural language. AI is not a sidebar plugin — it's a first-class input alongside mouse and keyboard.

### Target Users (by priority)

1. Individual makers / hobbyist designers (competes with: Onshape Free, TinkerCAD, Shapr3D)
2. Small industrial / product design studios (competes with: Fusion 360 Personal)
3. Education market (bulk licensing)

### Non-goals

- No FEA / CFD / simulation (leave to Ansys / SimScale)
- No sculpting (leave to Blender / ZBrush)
- No PCB / circuit design
- MVP: no collaboration / cloud storage (v1 offline-first, v2 adds cloud)

## MVP Roadmap (v0.1 ~ v0.6, ~6 months solo + AI assist)

### v0.1 — "Draw a part" (~1 month)

- [x] Tauri + React + Three.js scaffold
- [x] Viewport: orbit camera / zoom / pan / view switching (Top/Front/Right/Iso)
- [ ] Plane selection + enter sketch mode
- [ ] Sketch tools: line / rectangle / circle / arc
- [ ] 5 basic constraints: horizontal, vertical, parallel, equal, distance
- [ ] Exit sketch → extrude → first solid body
- [ ] Project file `.studio3d` save / load (with feature tree)

### v0.2 — "Complete parts" (~+1 month)

- [ ] Extrude / revolve / sweep / loft — 4 core features
- [ ] Fillet / chamfer / shell
- [ ] Pattern: linear / circular / mirror
- [ ] Browser tree (left panel) + timeline (bottom)
- [ ] Feature parameter double-click edit + recalculation

### v0.3 — "AI assists" (~+1 month)

- [ ] AI panel (reuse Vector Studio implementation)
- [ ] Register all modeling tools for AI
- [ ] Natural language commands:
  - "Draw a 100×50×20 block, drill a ⌀30 hole on the top face" → direct part output
  - "Add 2mm fillet to all outer edges" → auto-select edges and fillet
  - "What's the total mass? Use ABS density" → call measure tool
- [ ] Vision: user can circle a face and ask "Can I add a rib here?"

### v0.4 — "External exchange" (~+1 month)

- [ ] STEP import / export
- [ ] STL export
- [ ] 3MF export (with color)
- [ ] Screenshot / PNG export

### v0.5 — "Communication" (~+1 month)

- [ ] Drawing workspace: 3D → 2D projection + annotation
- [ ] Auto dimensioning (AI-assisted)
- [ ] PDF export
- [ ] DXF export

### v0.6 — "Manufacturing" (~+1 month)

- [ ] CAM basics: 3-axis pocket / contour
- [ ] G-code output (reuse Vector Studio `plotter.ts` approach)
- [ ] Tool library basics (endmill / ballnose / V-bit)

## Technical Decisions

See the original design document for full tech stack rationale. Key choices:

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| UI | React 19 + TypeScript (strict), hooks only |
| Build | Vite 8 |
| Styling | TailwindCSS 3 + CSS variables |
| State | Zustand |
| Desktop | Tauri 2 |
| 3D | Three.js r170+ (WebGPU, WebGL2 fallback) |
| B-rep kernel | Replicad (OCCT.js wrapper) |
| Sketch solver | planegcs (FreeCAD solver, wasm) |
| Boolean / mesh | manifold-3d |
| LLM | Claude API (direct browser access) |
| AI protocol | MCP (HTTP + SSE) |

### Architecture Rules

- `lib/geometry/` — B-rep pure functions, zero DOM, zero React
- `lib/sketch/` — 2D sketch + constraint solver, zero DOM
- `lib/features/` — Feature definitions + DAG recalculation
- `lib/cam/` — Toolpath generation (independent engine)
- `lib/io/` — File format import/export
- `lib/ai/` — LLM integration + tool registration
- `components/` — Rendering / interaction only, no business logic
- `store/` — Zustand store, serializable state only
- `src-tauri/` — Native commands (fs, dialog, shell, OS integration)

### Performance Rules

- Viewport: 60 FPS target (100k triangles)
- Any operation >16ms → Web Worker
- GPU pick buffer for selection (no raycaster)
- BVH acceleration for large meshes (three-mesh-bvh)
- Incremental DAG for geometry recalculation

### Quality Rules

- Every `lib/*` module has vitest tests
- Workspace switch paths covered by Playwright E2E
- AI tool calls have contract tests (input → expected output)
- ESLint + tsc strict + zero warnings for merge

## Key Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| OCCT.js wasm too large (30 MB+) | High | Slow first paint | Split worker + streaming load + SW precache |
| Topology naming instability | Very high | Parametric crash | Spike in week 1, validate FreeCAD ElementMap |
| Sketch solver perf | Medium | Complex sketch lag | planegcs + offline benchmark: 50 constraints <100ms |
| Geometry boolean slow | Medium | Mesh-heavy lag | mesh boolean via manifold-3d, B-rep via OCCT |
| AI corrupts geometry | High | Data loss | Snapshot before every AI op, one-click rollback |
| WebGPU browser support | Low (widely available 2025+) | Old Chrome fails | WebGL2 fallback |

## Changelog

- `2026-05-29`: Initial scaffold — Tauri 2 + React 19 + Vite 8 + Three.js + Zustand + TailwindCSS
- `2026-05-29`: Hardening pass — fixed compile/test blockers and added build automation:
  - Removed duplicate `computeVertexDistancePercentiles` in `brep.ts` (was breaking `tsc`/esbuild)
  - Fixed sketch solver `applyDistance` (aliasing + wrong sign) and symmetric extrude offset
  - `createBox` now names its body `Box`; fillet retains original faces; feature tree falls
    back to an explicit profile when the parent sketch is empty
  - `FeatureEditor` no longer mutates store state — added `updateFeature` store/tree action
  - Added jsdom test environment (`vitest.config.ts`); all 192 unit tests pass
  - Added `@tauri-apps/api` + plugin packages + CLI; created `capabilities/default.json`,
    app icons, and the missing `dirs` crate; `cargo check`/`clippy`/`fmt` clean
  - Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint/typecheck/test/build + Rust checks) and
    `release.yml` (macOS arm64/x64, Windows, Linux desktop clients via tauri-action)
- `2026-05-30`: Iterative improvement loop (tests 73 → 296, all green):
  - Modeling: primitives box/cylinder/sphere/cone/torus; feature-tree evaluators
    for revolve/fillet/chamfer/shell/linear&circular array/mirror; scale, rotate,
    weld (mesh repair)
  - New `lib/print` module: overhang/support (bed-excluded), support volume, mass,
    build-volume fit + scale-to-fit, stability/tip-over, bed contact & warp,
    recommended orientation + orientForPrint, filament/time estimate, print-readiness
  - CAM feeds & speeds calculator
  - IO: STL import (auto-weld) + OBJ import/export
  - ~30 AI tools covering create/edit/pattern/import/analyze/optimize + CAM
  - Store: `directBodies` so AI-created bodies survive recompute
  - Rendering: discrete-GPU request, DPR clamp, pause-when-hidden
  - Bug fixes: duplicate fn, sketch distance solver, symmetric extrude, outward
    side normals, consistent winding (translation-invariant volume), bed-face
    overhang overcount
